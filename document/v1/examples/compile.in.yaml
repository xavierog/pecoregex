# This document holds 4 patterns.
# Once processed, it will reflect whether each pattern successfully compiles through the "compile" boolean attribute.
patterns:

# The simplest way to declare a pattern:
- value: '^(?i)hello'

# It is possible to state an array of compile-time options:
- value: 'hello'
  options:
  - 'PCRE_ANCHORED'
  - 'PCRE_CASELESS'

# Options can be expressed like this too:
- value: 'hello'
  options: 'caseless|anchored'
# By default, pecoregex normalises such options into an array of uppercase, "PCRE_"-prefixed options.

# This one will not compile; the "error" attribute will reflect both the compile error ("message" attribute) and the
# offset it was found at ("offset" attribute)
- value: 'hello('
